# SteamDeck Refresh Rate Unlocker
This repository contains the instructions and scripts on how to unlock the Steam Deck under SteamOS to use upto 70Hz refresh rate for the display (do not confuse this with FPS). \
Discord user dan2wik for the idea on overclocking the display panel to 70Hz!

## What does this script do?!?
1. The script checks if the gamescope-session is using the default values 40,60Hz refresh rates.
2. If it's the default values, the script will create a backup of the file and then "patches" accordingly to what the user has chosen.
3. The script creates a folder called ~/1RefreshRateUnlocker that contains additional helper scripts. Do not delete this folder!
4. The script checks the gamescope-session every startup if it needs to be "patched" and applies the patch if needed.
5. There is an uninstall script if end-user wants to revert any changes made.

## Prerequisites for SteamOS
